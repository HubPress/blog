== HubPress supports RSS!

RSS feed is now available at the url `<url_of_your_blog>/rss`!
It is rebuild when:

* you publish a post,
* you change the content of a published post,
* you unpublish a post,
* you change your settings

In the past we have removed the RSS link on each theme because RSS was not available, themes have been updated and links are here.

== Upgrade are simpler with a link

You can find a new item in the main menu, *Check for upgrade*:

It will redirect you to {url_github}[GitHub] and you will be able to upgrade your instance in the right way.

We also have added the version add the bottom of the main menu:

* feat(admin): add a link to check if an upgrade is available
* fix(template): fix a bug with the pagination on gh-pages
* fix(theme): fix the typo of the theme saga
* fix(admin): add the version of the application and donation items
