== HubPress supports RSS!

RSS feed is now available at the url `<url_of_your_blog>/rss`!
It is rebuild when:

* you publish a post,
* you change the content of a published post,
* you unpublish a post,
* you change your settings

In the past we have removed the RSS link on each because it was not available, themes have been updated and links are here.

== 

* feat(admin): add a link to check if an upgrade is available
* fix(template): fix a bug with the pagination on gh-pages
* fix(theme): fix the typo of the theme saga
* fix(admin): add the version of the application and donation items
