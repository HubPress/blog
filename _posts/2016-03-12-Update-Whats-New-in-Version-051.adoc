== Themes

WARNING: Breaking Change. Action required.

Release 0.4.0 added two new themese: ghostium and uno-zen. 

What we noticed is that the theme folders used a mixture of upper and lower case, which made it tricky to set the theme correctly in the Admin console.

In {release} *all theme names have been changed to lowercase*. This is breaking change, and you will need to check that the theme you've chosen in the Settings are lowercase.

Refer to the folder names in the `/themes` folder in your repository, or in the `Administration.adoc` Admin Guide. 

== Multi-user Support for Post Attribution

Technically, HubPress already allowed to you set a collaborator on your repo so more than one user could write posts. 

What HubPress didn't do was honour the post creator (author) if the settings were changed, and the site was regenerated. 

With {release}, if you write a blog post, your GitHub user name will always be attached to the post. 

If you create a blog post, then another blogger on your team publishes it, the person who originally created the post is credited with writing the post.

In a future release, we plan on enhancing how writer attribution is handled in the post, so stay tuned.

== Edit and Delete Blog Posts

You no longer have to "delete" blogs posts by reusing an unwanted, unpublished blog post. 

The action overflow (three dots menu) next to each of your posts now has a `Delete` button.

== Editor Validation for Blog Posts

In versions prior to {release}, if you didn't have a level 1 heading starting your blog post, you were not able to save your blog post. The error that displayed as a result of this was not clear, which caused frustration for some users.

In {release}, the editor now has basic validation built into the editor, where if you don't start your blog with a Level 1 heading, there are no Preview or Save buttons in the editor. This is a visual clue to you to check your blog structure. 

If you want some tips on writing successful blog posts with HubPress, check out the _Writers' Guide_ in your repository.

== Documentation 

The documentation for HubPress has undergone further improvements to better align the content.

The Administration guide has had a content shuffle to remove information that should have been in the Writer's Guide.

The Writer's Guide had some stray Administration content in it, which has now been moved into it's proper home.

Check out the docs and let us know if you see room for improvement.
