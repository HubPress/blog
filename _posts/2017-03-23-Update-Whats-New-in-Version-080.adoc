= Update: What's New in Version 0.8.0


== The configuration form

You do not need to change the *config.json* anymore, now you can do it with the *Configuration form*.
This form appears when the configuration of your repository is not done.
You have to set the mandatory fields (username, repository name and the branch) and the domain name if you have one.

Click on the *Ok, let's go!* button and you will be redirect to the login form.
Then login and the configuration will be save on your repository.

That's it!
