= Update: What's New in Version 0.8.0


== The configuration form

You do not need to change the *config.json* anymore, now you can do it with the *Configuration form*.
This form appears when the configuration of your repository is not done.
You have to set the mandatory fields (username, repository name and the branch) and the domain name if you have one.

Click on the *Ok, let's go!* button and you will be redirect to the login form.
Then login and the configuration will be save on your repository.

That's it!

== A new theme is here: The Shell

Some of you wanted to have a dark theme so we added one.
You can now use the theme *the-shell* in your settings, here is a sample of the result with my personal blog:
