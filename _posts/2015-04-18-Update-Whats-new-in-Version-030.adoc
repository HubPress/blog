The main goal of this version is to take into account the changes made on the https://developer.github.com/changes/2015-02-20-migration-period-removing-authorizations-token/[Authorization API]

IMPORTANT: You must update your version of HubPress before the 20 April 2015.

== What differences does it make?
When you login in HubPress, a personal token is created in your Github account.

With the version 0.3.0, we create a token by environment (browser + os) which is deleted at each login:

The consequence is that you can't open multiple tabs in the same browser to work on HubPress
